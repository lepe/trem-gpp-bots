Tremulous GPP bots module by GlobalWarming
------------------------------------------

The current code was based on a P-Bot 2.x GPP port from Tremulous 1.1 P-Bot (http://tremulous.net/forum/index.php?topic=15329.0) which uses Tremulous version SVN2279 (from http://svn.icculus.org/tremulous/trunk/).

After that, several things has been improved:

* Aliens wall-walking (when available) was prioritized over jumping
* Humans bots can buy and use granades (they use them against buildings)
* ATCS Path was improved
* Battlesuits are now displayed (before they were not shown)
* Humans bots aim against buildings fixed
* Weird "possesion" bug (player replaced bot) fixed
* botcmd BOTNAME give (command added)
* Bots are now "ready" on intermission
