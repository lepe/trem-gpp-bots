  "Why BotsCamp?"
  {
    "This is a fun server to play when very few people are on and your waiting for "
    "more to join. Also there are some fun challenging layouts that already exist "
    "that are good for both single player and coop.\n"
    "That is one of the objectives of BotsCamp, the other objectives are to have a "
    "training server for beginners as well as to help fine tune the skills of more "
    "experienced players, and to allow for single player and coop tremulous games.\n"
